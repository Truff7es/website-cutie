        <h2>Data and Information</h2>

        <h3>Data</h3>
        <p>
            Data represents raw elements or unprocessed facts, from numerical values and symbolic
            representations to textual content and visual imagery. When collected and observed without
            interpretation, these elements remain mere data points—discrete and disorganized entities
            lacking inherent meaning or significance. (Jain, 2025).
        </p>

        <h3>Information</h3>
        <p>
            You get information when data is processed, organized, interpreted, and structured. The
            comprehensible output derived from raw data helps inform decisions, strategies, and actions.
            Information is data made valuable and accessible—an integral component of decision-making.
            (Jain, 2025)
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Information Systems</h2>
        <p>
            An information system (IS) is an interconnected set of components used to collect, store, process
            and transmit data and digital information. At its core, it is a collection of hardware, software,
            data, people and processes that work together to transform raw data into useful information.
            An IS supports a variety of business objectives, such as improved customer service or increased
            operational efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
            Typically, an IS comprises an integrated set of hardware and software, plus databases and
            communications networks that facilitate data collection, storage and use. People and processes
            are also vital components of an IS. (Awati, 2024)
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Different Types of Support Systems in Information Systems</h2>

        <h3>Management Information System (MIS)</h3>
        <p>
            These computerized systems collect, store, process and present data to support management
            decision-making. Different kinds of organizations and industries use different types of MISes.
            For example, an MIS in a hospital may collect data on patient admissions, treatments and
            outcomes to help administrators make decisions about resource allocation and process
            improvements.
        </p>

        <h3>Decision Support System (DSS)</h3>
        <p>
            A DSS enables users to explore and analyze data to gain insights into business performance and,
            accordingly, make data-driven decisions. For example, a retail chain may use a DSS to collect
            and analyze data on customer demographics, buying behavior and sales performance in order to
            guide changes in inventory management and marketing campaigns. A DSS is also known as a
            business intelligence (BI) system.
        </p>

        <h3>Knowledge Work System (KWS)</h3>
        <p>
            These systems provide useful insights for knowledge workers, such as researchers, analysts
            and consultants. For example, marketing analysts may use a KWS to analyze customer data and
            track the performance of marketing campaigns.
        </p>

        <h3>Executive Information System (EIS)</h3>
        <p>
            An EIS provides high-level information about the company's financial performance, market
            trends, competitive landscape and so on. It also provides analytical tools that enable senior
            executives to make strategic decisions based on the available information.
        </p>

        <h3>Knowledge Management System (KMS)</h3>
        <p>
            A KMS is an information system used to update and manage the organization's knowledge resources.
        </p>

        <h3>Inventory Management System (IMS)</h3>
        <p>
            An IMS collects inventory information and generates insights to help with inventory management.
        </p>

        <h3>Transaction Processing System (TPS)</h3>
        <p>
            A TPS processes transactional data and generates useful insights to help streamline transactional
            processes.
        </p>

        <h2>Analysis and Reaction</h2>
        <p>
            When most people hear the word “data,” they often just think of numbers, facts, or details that
            have been gathered and placed into some kind of chart or document. While that’s not totally
            wrong, it doesn’t really capture the bigger picture, especially when we’re talking about computers
            and the fields connected to them. Data in computer studies isn’t just about collecting information;
            it’s about how that information is processed, organized, and turned into something meaningful
            that people can actually use. That’s where the concept of information comes in, because data on
            its own can feel random or incomplete, but once it’s interpreted, it becomes useful knowledge.
        </p>

        <p>
            This lesson focuses on understanding the difference between data and information, diving into what
            information systems are, and exploring the various types of information systems that play a huge
            role in technology today. Beginning with Data and Information, data refers to raw facts like
            numbers, texts, symbols, or images that have no real use on their own. Once processed and
            organized, data becomes information, which carries meaning and value. Information is what guides
            decisions, strategies, and actions, making it far more useful than plain data. (Jain, 2025). This
            difference matters because data without context is just random, while information is what people
            and organizations actually depend on to solve problems and plan effectively.
        </p>

        <p>
            Information Systems (IS) is an integrated set of components for collecting, storing and processing
            data. Information systems use technology and structure to collect, process, and share data, helping
            people and organizations work efficiently. They combine hardware, software, networks, people, and
            processes to ensure information is stored and managed properly. What makes them unique is that
            they are not only technical tools but also social systems, since people interact with the technology
            to keep information accurate, reliable, and meaningful for decision-making and problem-solving in
            different settings. These are the systems that provide productivity and interaction.
        </p>

        <p>
            The 7 different kinds of IS (Information Systems) are as follows: Transaction Processing Systems
            (TPS) manage daily tasks like billing, payroll, and reservations. Management Information Systems
            (MIS) take TPS data and turn it into structured reports for decision-making. Decision Support Systems
            (DSS) go further by offering analytical tools, while Executive Support Systems (ESS) guide leaders
            toward long-term strategies. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) integrates organizational processes
            into one system, while Supply Chain Management (SCM) improves customer relations and logistics.
            Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) gather and share organizational knowledge to prevent repetition
            and support teamwork (Awati, 2024).
        </p>

        <p>
            Together, these systems demonstrate how information systems are vital in all industries. They shape
            how organizations operate, grow, and adapt to challenges, showing their importance not only in
            efficiency but also in maintaining competitiveness in today’s fast-changing world.
