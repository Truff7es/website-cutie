    <h1>Computer Science as a Discipline</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p>
            Computer science is the systematic study of automated computation. 
            It became a formal discipline in the late 1950s and early 1960s, originating 
            from the efforts of electrical engineers and mathematicians who sought to build 
            devices capable of mechanical computation. (Kaiser, D., n.d.)
        </p>

        <p>
            It focuses on the development and testing of software and software systems. 
            This involves working with mathematical models, algorithms, data analysis, security, 
            and computational theory. Computer scientists define the computational principles 
            that form the foundation of all software.

        <h2>Computer Engineering</h2>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>
            Computer engineering combines principles of computer science and electrical 
            engineering to design and develop software and hardware systems. (Staff, 2025)
        </p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
            Computer Engineering emerged in the mid-20th century. Jesiek (2013) traces 
            its development between the 1940s and 1950s when engineering expanded to 
            include computer hardware design. Its growth accelerated during World War II and 
            continues to shape technology today.

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Computer Science</h2>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>
            Computer science is the study of computers, computational systems, algorithms, 
            artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and software development. It combines 
            theoretical foundations with hands-on experience.
        </p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
            Computer science became an independent discipline in the early 1960s, although 
            digital computers were invented earlier. Its roots lie in mathematics, electrical 
            engineering, physics, and management information systems.
        </p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Information Systems</h2>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>
            Information Systems (IS) are integrated components for collecting, storing, 
            processing, and providing information. Businesses rely on IS for operations, 
            customer interactions, and competition.
        </p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
            From 1950s transaction systems to cloud computing and AI today, IS evolved through 
            mainframes, Decision Support Systems (DSS), personal computers, Executive Information 
            Systems (EIS), and internet-based technologies.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Information Technology</h2>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>
            Information Technology (IT) uses computers, networks, and other digital systems to 
            store, process, and exchange data. It plays a major role in business operations.
        </p>

        <h3>Types of IT</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Internet and web technologies</li>
            <li>Cloud computing</li>
            <li>Databases</li>
            <li>AI & Machine Learning</li>
            <li>Cybersecurity</li>
            <li>Internet of Things</li>
            <li>Data Analytics</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>
            Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and 
            maintaining software. It uses various tools and methodologies across development.
        </p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
            Born from the “software crisis” of the 1960s, software engineering grew into a 
            structured discipline after the 1968 NATO conference. Margaret Hamilton coined 
            the term during the Apollo missions. Development evolved from waterfall models 
            to agile methodologies in the 1990s.

        <h2>Analysis & Reaction</h2>
        <p>
            Computer Science plays a major role in today’s digital society. With new devices 
            emerging every year, the field continues to shape how we work, communicate, and 
            innovate.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a BSIT student, I see how each discipline contributes differently to technology. 
            These lessons deepen my appreciation of IT and inspire me to carry this knowledge 
            forward.
